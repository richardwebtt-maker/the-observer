    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Your privacy is important to us.</p>
    <p>Last updated: June 30, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to The Observer. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting any personal information you
        provide or that we collect automatically.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        We do not require you to register or provide personal details. The only information we automatically collect is
        your IP address, which we use solely to remember your chosen display theme (light or dark) so that when you
        return to the site, your preference is preserved.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Theme Persistence:</strong> We store your IP address transiently to recall whether you prefer light
            or dark mode.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> use your IP address for advertising, analytics, tracking across third‑party sites, or
        any other purpose.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>
        We do not use cookies, local storage, or any other tracking technologies beyond temporarily associating your IP
        address with a theme setting.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>
        We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your IP address or any other data to outside parties. Your
        information remains within our system solely for the purpose described above.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>
        While no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, we take reasonable measures to safeguard the
        small amount of data we collect.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Our site is not directed at children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect information from them.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here with a revised “Last updated” date.
    </p>
